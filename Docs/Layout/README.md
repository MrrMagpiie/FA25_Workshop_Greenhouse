# Along the left side fo the first couple pages ive got a simple page menu that should minimise when interacting with the main section of the page as shown in the latter two pages

# The first page is a simple settings menu attached to the hamberger menu symbol in the page menu. In this page there should be a couple of buttons used to add new plants and sensors to the system as well as whatever other settings come up durring development
# the second page is the plant page attached to the little plant symbol in the page menu. in this page we should be able to see the plants in the system and see the current readings for the sensors attached to these plants as well as a timer showing an estimante on how long before the plant is ready to harvest
# the third page is the tank page which is attached to the little tanks symbol in the page menu. in this page we should be able to see that current stats for the tanks attached to the system. a prominant card for the water/neutriant tank with current readings and then smaller cards for the individual additive tanks showing how full they currently are and possibly an esimation for how long before they need to be replaced.
# the fourth page is the graph page which is attached to the graph symbol in the page menu, in this menu we should be able to view historical data for the system in the main window at the top and be able to adjust the displayed information with the buttons in the panel at the bottom. 

# this is all just a rough idea and if anyone has better ideas please don't hesitate to speak up.
