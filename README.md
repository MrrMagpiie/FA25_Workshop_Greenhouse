# Old_Ones_Greenhouse

Welcome to the Old_Ones_Greenhouse project! This repository hosts the collaborative efforts of our Software Engineering, Web Development, and Computer Workshop teams as we build a hydroponic greenhouse management and automation system.

The goal of this project is to develop a system for managing and automating a hydroponic greenhouse. This system will include both hardware and software components to monitor and optimize plant growth conditions.

## Planned Features

Our minimum viable product (MVP) will include:

  - Sensor Array: An array of sensors to measure key environmental attributes, such as temperature, light levels, and nutrient bath pH.
  - Automation Machinery: Equipment to automate the maintenance of critical environmental attributes. This includes:
      - Exhaust fans for temperature control
      - Grow lights for managing light levels
      - Nutrient dosers for maintaining nutrient levels
  - Database: A robust database to store sensor data and provide insights into the greenhouse environment.
  - Web Interface: A webpage to display current and historical sensor data, enabling users to monitor and analyze environmental conditions in real-time.

### Additional Features

While these features are not part of the MVP, they are potential enhancements:

- Plant-Specific Database: A database of optimal environmental attributes for various plants. This feature would enable automatic adjustments to environmental conditions based on the specific needs of different plants.
- Experimental Analytics: Using sensor data to experiment with and determine the best environmental conditions for plant growth.
- AI Integration: Training an AI to identify physical signs of nutrient deficiencies in plants based on and image feed.


## Contributing

# Note from Taran
I've never managed a Github repo before so I'm not sure what the best way to do all this is, if you've got any advice please let me know. Otherwise we are just gonna have to figure it out as we go.
