Welcome to the Old_Ones_Greenhouse project! This repository hosts the collaborative efforts of our Software Engineering, Web Development, and Computer Workshop teams as we build a hydroponic greenhouse management and automation system.

The goal of this project is to develop a system for managing and automating a hydroponic greenhouse. This system will include both hardware and software components to monitor and optimize plant growth conditions.

## Wiki/Documentation

The documentation wiki for this project it currently hosted on Github pages through this link [https://mrrmagpiie.github.io/Old_Ones_Greenhouse/](https://mrrmagpiie.github.io/Old_Ones_Greenhouse/) The repo for this site is the pagss branch of this repo

## Planned Features

Our minimum viable product (MVP) will include:

- Sensor Array: An array of sensors to measure key environmental attributes, such as temperature, light levels, and nutrient bath PH.
- Automation Machinery: Equipment to automate the maintenance of critical environmental attributes. This includes:
    - Exhaust fans for temperature control
    - Grow lights for managing light levels
    - Nutrient dosers for maintaining nutrient levels
- Database: A robust database to store sensor data and provide insights into the greenhouse environment.
- Web Interface: A webpage to display current and historical sensor data, enabling users to monitor and analyze environmental conditions in real-time.

### Additional Features

While these features are not part of the MVP, they are potential enhancements:

- Plant-Specific Database: A database of optimal environmental attributes for various plants. This feature would enable automatic adjustments to environmental conditions based on the specific needs of different plants.
- Experimental Analytics: Using sensor data to experiment with and determine the best environmental conditions for plant growth.
- AI Integration: Training an AI to identify physical signs of nutrient deficiencies in plants based on an image feed.
